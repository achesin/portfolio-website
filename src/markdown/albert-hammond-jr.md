#Albert Hammond, Jr.

I had an amazing opportunity to photograph Albert Hammond, Jr. when he stopped by Crescent Ballroom in Phoenix on March 7th, 2019. His energy was absolutely incredible in this tiny, 500-capacity room, and he ran around the crowd multiple times, really getting everyone engaged. It was such a joy to photograph- if I could photograph Albert every night, I would be happy! The first shot here is one of my all time favorites, that I took in the middle of the crowd! Here's the pics, all taken on a Canon T3i with a 50mm f/1.8 lens. Photographed for KAMP Radio.
