#Mary Antonini

I got the opportunity to have a shoot with Mary Antonini, seen in the Original Broadway Cast of "The Prom", a week before the show closed. I felt really challenged during this photo shoot and Mary helped bring me out of my comfort zone. I'm incredibly proud of the portraits we created together- see them below!
