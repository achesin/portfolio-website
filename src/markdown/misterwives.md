#Misterwives

I had the opportunity of a lifetime to photograph Misterwives at Brooklyn Steel in Brooklyn, New York for the opening night of their headlining No Place Like Home Tour. Misterwives is my favorite band on the planet, so this was a really special moment for me. Forever gracious to Marc for getting me a photo pass. Still in awe of the moment Will noticed me in the photo pit- see that photo and so many more below! Shot on a Canon 6D Mark II with a 50mm f/1.8 lens and a 25-105mm f/4.0 lens.
