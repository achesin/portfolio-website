#MUNA

I had such an amazing experience photographing MUNA at the Music Hall of Williamsburg in Brooklyn, New York for their headlining show on the Saves the World tour on October 10th, 2019. The first of two nights in the venue, I sang along to every song and left feeling so inspired. This band has an amazing energy and it is truly something special to witness. See the gallery below. Shot on a Canon 6D Mark II with a 50mm f/1.8 lens and a 25-105mm f/4.0 lens. Shot for Dissolving Film Magazine.
