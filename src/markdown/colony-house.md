#Colony House

I was able to photograph Colony House at the Rialto Theatre in Tucson, Arizona when they opened for Switchfoot on April 3rd, 2019. I was most excited to see them perform, and they put on a great show with great lighting, so I was able to capture it well. Here's the pics, all were taken on a Canon T3i with a 50mm f/1.8 lens. Photographed for KAMP Radio.
