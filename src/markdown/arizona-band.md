#A R I Z O N A

I was able to photograph ARIZONA at the Van Buren in Phoenix, Arizona when they headlined on April 3rd, 2019. I've become good friends with their tour manager and I am very grateful for the opportunity to have shot this show. Here's the pics, all were taken on a Canon T3i with a 50mm f/1.8 lens.
