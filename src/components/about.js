				<p>Hello welcome to my website for my photography. I am an NYC based photographer. I am making this website from scratch to become a better software enginner and to show off my photos because I am very proud of them.</p>
				<p><strong>I want to help capture your joy.</strong> Let's make it happen. Hit me up for a photo session or a quick photo shoot or to photograph your concert. I have done it all and would love to do it with you!</p>
